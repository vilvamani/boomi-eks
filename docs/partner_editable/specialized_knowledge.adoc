This Quick Start assumes familiarity with basic concepts of networking, bastion hosts, volume sizing, and compute performance. It also assumes familiarity with the Dell Boomi variables that are required when deploying a Molecule cluster. These variables include Molecule Name, Local Path, Local Temp Path, Account Id, Account Name, and Account Password. If you don’t have have an Account Name or Password, you can enter an installation token provided by your system administrator into the *Boomi MFA install token* field.
